# to-do-List
Javascript based application that helps you add your todoâ€™s and delete it when you are done with it.<br>
Check out the live project here: https://infinite-oasis-21273.herokuapp.com <br>
You can create dynamic to-do pages by passing the name of the to-do page in url as path-name i.e (https://infinite-oasis-21273.herokuapp.com/path-name)<br>
If that to-do page already exists, it will be displayed , else a whole new to-do page will be created.
